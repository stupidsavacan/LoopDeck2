# Review semantics

LoopDeck has two review-related data systems, but only one of them schedules future reviews.

## Ownership

### SRS (`ReviewCard` / `ReviewLog`)

SRS owns automatic scheduling. It decides `dueAt`, interval, ease, and the state shown in the "今日の復習" queue.

Normal runtime states are:

| State | Meaning | Normal entry | Normal exit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `new` | no scheduled review yet | card creation | first rated answer -> `review` or `relearning` |
| `review` | scheduled normal review | correct answer | correct stays `review`; repeated recent failures can enter `leech` |
| `relearning` | retry after a failed answer | `again` | correct -> `review`; repeated recent failures can enter `leech` |
| `leech` | recent failure pressure is high; needs focused review | recent repeated `again` ratings | a correct answer -> `review` |
| `mastered` | long correct streak with a long interval | stable correct answers | failure -> `relearning` |

`leechLevel` is a bounded recent-failure pressure signal. Historical `totalWrong` and `lapseCount` remain analytics counters; they do not permanently force `leech` or permanently prevent `mastered`.

### Compatibility-only states

- `learning` is retained in `ReviewState` so old persisted data/backups remain readable. Normal scheduling no longer writes it. A legacy `learning` card is handled as `relearning` in due buckets and UI.
- state value `suspended` and the `suspended` flag are retained for persisted-data compatibility. Suspended cards are excluded from automatic due queues. There is currently no normal user-facing transition that creates a suspended card.

## History weak queue (`Attempt`)

The history-based weak queue is analytics/advisory. It ranks candidates for a user-started weak-point review session; it does **not** write SRS `dueAt` or decide the automatic review date.

The default Review Center scope uses the recent-study window and recency weighting introduced for issue #24. All-history mode remains available for old material.

## Reset semantics

The two data sets are intentionally independent:

- **SRS予定だけリセット** deletes `ReviewCard` / `ReviewLog`. It does not delete answer history, so a question may still appear as a history-based weak candidate.
- **ミス履歴だけ消す** deletes wrong/revealed attempt history. It does not delete SRS state or due dates, so a question may still appear in "今日の復習".

UI confirmation text must state these independent effects explicitly.
